Howdy, Holos!

Thanks for giving me the time of day to look at some of my stuff!

I left some debug stuff in so you can see a little of the behind the scenes stuff. I would usually clear that all out before pushing anything.
Please take a look at some of the comments left throughout for a little context of my thought process/struggles as well.

There is a lot of stuff that I would add and polish up with more time (i.e. fixing the ai a bit, airial combat w/gunfire and such, win condition, etc.), but I didn't want to keep asking for extensions.

Both PS4 controller and keyboard input are supported! Check the UI in the Main scene to see how to fly!

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments! I am always open to feedback (especially when I am aware there are some things that are rough around the edges)!
